### Abstract

The objective of this work is to build a classier that, starting from a set of measurements, is able to detect if a patient is affected by the Chronic Kidney Disease. Chronic kidney disease is a type of kidney disease in which there is gradual loss of kidney function over a period of months to years. Initially there are generally no symptoms; later, symptoms may include leg swelling, feeling tired, vomiting, loss of appetite, and confusion. Complications include an increased risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, bone disease and anemia. 
<br>In order to do that, we will start in analyzing the Chronic_Kidney_Disease DataSet available on UCI Machine Learning Repository and then, after knowing better the data, we will analyze the behavior of few classifiers in order to find the best performing on our data. All analysis will be done using Python and the complete code can be found in the Jupyter Notebook associated to this report.
